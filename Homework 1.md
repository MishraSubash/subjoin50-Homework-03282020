# **V**. **Recommendations:**

1. The major revenue sources for Financial business is from online payment platform and personal wealth management services, there are more like traditional finance. I personally think and recommend Ant Financial put more focus in Blockchain Technology and AI for P2P and other similar business model. 

2. It is also extending services in insurance business lately, so as I suggest using AI and blockchain to go into Insurtech would be beneficial in future for Ant Financial.

3. Ant Financial has engaging in other than FinTech industry despite still room for growth in its home market, and the company has stakes in burgeoning Asian startups, including Indian Payment company.
